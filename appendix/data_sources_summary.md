## Data Sources Summary

This project draws on a combination of primary qualitative data, secondary
research methods, and foundational research inputs to frame the problem,
interpret stakeholder needs, and inform strategy recommendations related to
soft-skill tracking in higher education.

### Primary Qualitative Data

**Stakeholder Interviews**
- **Participants:**
  - 4 STEM graduate students
  - 2 university career development advisors
  - 1 hiring manager
- **Method:** Semi-structured interviews conducted in person or via Zoom
- **Artifacts:** Interview protocol; affinity wall synthesis
- **Purpose:**
  - Understand how students develop and perceive soft skills
  - Identify barriers to engagement with career resources
  - Surface advisor constraints related to time, staffing, and data
  - Incorporate employer expectations for entry-level soft skills

Interview insights were synthesized using an affinity mapping process to
identify recurring themes, bottlenecks, and opportunity areas.

### Secondary Research Methods

The following secondary research methods were explicitly conducted to
contextualize interview findings, validate emerging themes, and broaden
understanding beyond primary interviews.

**Academic Articles & Industry Reports**
- Review of academic literature and industry reports to understand employer
  expectations, perceived skill gaps, and the role of soft skills in hiring
  and workplace performance.

**Artifact Analysis on Social Media Content**
- Analysis of professional social media content (e.g., LinkedIn postings) to
  identify how soft skills are discussed, signaled, and valued in real-world
  professional contexts.

**Focus Group**
- Group-based discussion used to observe how stakeholders interact with and
  build on each other’s ideas, supporting synthesis of shared concerns and
  divergent perspectives.

**Survey**
- Exploratory survey used to capture individual student experiences and
  subgroup behavior related to soft-skill development and engagement.

### Foundational Research Inputs

In addition to the methods above, the project drew on synthesized background
research to support problem framing and interpretation of findings. These
materials were not analyzed independently, but informed design constraints
and contextual understanding.

- Student stakeholder research  
- Soft-skill measurement approaches  
- Workplace and labor-market context  

Full materials are available in `appendix/research_foundation/`.

### Notes on Scope

This project focuses on STEM graduate students to enable targeted analysis and
design recommendations. Findings are qualitative and exploratory in nature and
are intended to inform strategy and system design rather than produce
generalizable statistical claims.

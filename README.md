# Soft Skills Tracking for STEM Graduate Students (Education Cloud Concept)

This project explores **why university career services struggle to measure and support students’ soft-skill growth**—and proposes a practical strategy for doing it *inside* **Salesforce Education Cloud**, where advising and student records already live.

Built as a research + strategy deliverable in partnership context with Salesforce’s original “job-to-skill alignment” challenge.  [oai_citation:0‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Stakeholder_Presentation.pdf](sediment://file_000000002f38722faa2cc4f675733c16)

## The problem we tackled

Soft skills matter more as AI changes how entry-level work is evaluated, but **students often don’t know how to intentionally develop them** and career offices don’t have reliable, scalable ways to track growth.  [oai_citation:1‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Stakeholder_Presentation.pdf](sediment://file_000000002f38722faa2cc4f675733c16)  [oai_citation:2‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000008d84722f80109a9bb495e9f6)

Salesforce’s original framing focused on the barriers career services face in **tracking soft skills and linking them to in-demand jobs**.  [oai_citation:3‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Stakeholder_Presentation.pdf](sediment://file_000000002f38722faa2cc4f675733c16)  
We refined the scope to focus on **STEM graduate students**, since their career pathways and constraints differ from undergrads and across majors.  [oai_citation:4‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000008d84722f80109a9bb495e9f6)

### Research question (HMW)
**How might we develop strategies that enable career services at universities to identify, quantify, and track the growth and development of STEM graduate students’ soft skills?**  [oai_citation:5‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000002be071fda3975b45810260e5)

## What we did

### Primary research
- **7 semi-structured interviews:** 4 STEM grad students, 2 career advisors (CDO), 1 hiring manager  [oai_citation:6‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000008d84722f80109a9bb495e9f6)

### Secondary research + synthesis
We complemented interviews with additional research and triangulation:
- **Academic articles / industry reports** (employer expectations + gaps)
- **Artifact analysis on social media content** (LinkedIn postings as “in the wild” soft-skill signals)
- **Focus group** (how stakeholders interact with each other’s ideas)
- **Survey** (individual + subgroup behavior)
- **Affinity wall (Miro)** for synthesis across sources  [oai_citation:7‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Stakeholder_Presentation.pdf](sediment://file_0000000084e071f59afa81213240783f)

## Key findings 

1. **Soft skills are mostly learned “by living,” not by formal plans.**  
   Many students develop them unintentionally through day-to-day situations rather than structured training.  [oai_citation:8‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Stakeholder_Presentation.pdf](sediment://file_0000000084e071f59afa81213240783f)

2. **Career services can’t easily track soft skills at scale—tooling and capacity are the bottleneck.**  
   Advisors reported they haven’t used external tools for tracking soft-skill development and face organizational/technical constraints.  [oai_citation:9‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Stakeholder_Presentation.pdf](sediment://file_0000000084e071f59afa81213240783f)

3. **Trust is the adoption problem: bias + validity concerns show up everywhere.**  
   Both students and advisors explicitly raised concerns that soft-skill assessment is vulnerable to cultural, linguistic, and gender bias—and that “subjective” tools won’t be trusted or used.  [oai_citation:10‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000008d84722f80109a9bb495e9f6)

4. **When students *do* want a tool, they want it to be: integrated, fast, and actionable.**  
   Students favored tools embedded into existing classes/curriculum, and interviews suggested the realistic time budget is roughly **15–30 minutes** outside class.  [oai_citation:11‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000008d84722f80109a9bb495e9f6)

## Proposed solution

We recommend **integration over addition**: capture soft-skill evidence where development already happens (coursework, projects, internships), instead of pushing standalone extracurricular tools.  [oai_citation:12‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000002be071fda3975b45810260e5)

### Concept: case-based experiential learning inside Education Cloud
An **experiential learning tool embedded in Salesforce Education Cloud** that:
- gives students **real-world scenarios** to demonstrate soft skills,
- provides **personalized, behavior-based feedback** (not just a score),
- stores evaluations over time to support **growth tracking** and advising follow-through.  [oai_citation:13‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_0000000021b471f5ad16efee1d035788)

This direction directly targets the constraints we heard most: engagement, trust, advisor workload, and feasibility within an existing platform.  [oai_citation:14‡Salesforce_Education_Cloud_Soft_Skills_Report.pdf](sediment://file_000000002be071fda3975b45810260e5)
